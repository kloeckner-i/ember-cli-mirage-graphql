# Deprecations

## Ember CLI Mirage GraphQL

This Ember addon is deprecated in favor of
[@miragejs/graphql](https://github.com/miragejs/graphql).

## varsMap (since 0.1.0)

This option has been renamed to `argsMap` and now explicitly provides support
for custom mapping of *argument* names in filters and mutations (rather than
*variable* names).
